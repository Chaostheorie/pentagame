                    An HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie,
                    browser cookie, or simply cookie) is a small piece of data
                    stored on the user's computer by the web browser while
                    browsing a website. Cookies were designed to be a reliable
                    mechanism for websites to remember stateful information
                    (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online
                    store) or to record the user's browsing activity (including
                    clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording which
                    pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to
                    remember pieces of information that the user previously
                    entered into form fields, such as names, addresses,
                    passwords, and payment card numbers.

                    Cookies are only used when <strong>necessary</strong>. The
                    authentication system stores an
                    <span class="text-monospace">auth</span> cookie after you
                    successfully authenticated by logging in. This cookie is
                    encrypted, limited to this domain, only editable by the
                    server and only valid for a limited amount of time. This
                    cookie is necessary for recognizing authenticated users.
                    Cookies may also be used to one-use-only allow for alerts
                    when logging out. Those cookies contain an encrypted version
                    of your username and unique id or a simple string. But
